Optimotu.pipeline is a workflow for DNA metabarcoding analysis, implemented as an R package.

The pipeline has currently been implemented in a separate, project-specific
repository (which is private) but functions are being gradually moved to this
package. The goal is that the package will eventually include functionality
to set up the full pipeline for a new project.

## Installation

You can install the development version of optimotu.pipeline from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("brendanf/optimotu.pipeline")
```
