}
\arguments{
\item{max_err}{(\code{numeric}) maximum error rate for adapter matching}

\item{min_overlap}{(\code{integer}) minimum overlap between read and adapter}

\item{action}{(\code{character}) action to take on the read; options are "trim",
"retain", "mask", "lowercase", "none"}

\item{discard_untrimmed}{(\code{logical}) discard reads that do not match the
adapter}

\item{max_n}{(\code{integer}) maximum number of Ns allowed in a read after trimming}

\item{max_ee}{(\code{numeric}) maximum expected errors in a read after trimming}

\item{min_length}{(\code{integer}) minimum length of a read after trimming}

\item{max_length}{(\code{integer}) maximum length of a read after trimming}

\item{truncQ}{(\code{integer}) quality score threshold for truncating the 3' end
of the read; or a vector of two integers for the 5' and 3' ends}

\item{cut}{(\code{integer}) number of bases to unconditionally cut from the 5' (if
positive) or 3' (if negative) end of the read prior to adapter trimming; or
a vector of two integers with different signs for both ends}
